                <p>
                    The UEFA Champions League (previously known as the European Cup, abbreviated as UCL, or sometimes, UEFA CL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.

                <h3>Team</h3>
                <p>
                    A total of 78 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Russia, who were banned from participating due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association<br/>
                    - Associations 1–4 each had four teams qualify.<br/>
                    - Associations 5–6 each had three teams qualify.<br/>
                    - Associations 7–15 (except Russia)each had two teams qualify.<br/>
                    - Associations 16–55 (except Liechtenstein)[Note LIE] each had one team qualify.<br/>
                    * The winners of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League and 2021–22 UEFA Europa League were each given an additional entry if they did not qualify for the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league.

                <h3>Rank</h3>
                <p>
                    For the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2021 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2016–17 to 2020–21.<br/>
                    Apart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League.
